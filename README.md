# Advent of Code 2021
To practice for 2024 and to try out Colab

I will put the test input in-line and my input in a file which is wiped after the session ends and so complies with the request not to post your individual input

After day for, I want a real debugger and will start posting .py files

## [Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture](day05.py)
Used a brute force approach, but it still finished right away

## [Day 6: Lanternfish](day06.py)
Part one can be finished by tracking individual fish, but part two needs a different approach to compute and seems to be the first part two to need this for 2021

## [Day 7: The Treachery of Whales](day07.py)
Temped to time a run with a more brute-force part 2 to see how long it would take, but this is just a warm up for 2024 at the moment
